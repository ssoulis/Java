INTRODUCTION :

Object-Oriented COMPUTER PROGRAMMING
As the name suggests, Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that use objects in programming, they use objects as a primary source to implement what is to happen in the code. Objects are seen by the viewer or user, performing tasks assigned by you. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc. in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language, which works on different operating systems such as Windows, Mac, and Linux.

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that allows you to package together data states and functionality to modify those data states, while keeping the details hidden away. As a result, code with OOP design is flexible, modular, and abstract. This makes it particularly useful when you create larger programs so
the purpose is to learn how to effectively program using Java.


VERSION or DATE: WINTER 2019

Some codes have comments while other do not, a lot of the projects are made as laboratory excercises and the file names will give you a hint on what the project is about.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME!
